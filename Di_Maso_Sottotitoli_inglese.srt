Welcome to this video, today I will talk about the 1.4.12 criterion concerning spacing

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:13,400
What is the purpose of this policy ?, the purpose of this policy is to provide users with a better reading experience.

3
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:27,566
Furthermore, this criterion focuses on the possibility of increasing the spacing between lines, words, letters and paragraphs and any of these combinations can help the user to effectively read the text.

4
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:39,999
Of this criterion I decided to deepen the parameters that allow the user, even those with difficulty, a better view of the text, without causing loss of content and functionality.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,100
 
Among these parameters is the line height which must be at least 1.5 times the font size.

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,900
 
To represent this parameter I used the line-height and set it to two

7
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:11,466
and as we can see, there is a distance, which is double the font size, between one line and another.

8
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:25,532
In fact, by increasing the height of the line, the distance between one line and another will also increase.

9
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:34,399
 
Next is the spacing after the paragraphs, which must be at least twice the font size.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:51,666
 
In this case I decided to set the margin-bottom, I set it to two and as we can see this is the result that appears on the internet and of course by increasing the value, the distance between one paragraph and another will also increase.

11
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:51,699


12
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:00,966
 
Moving forward, there is the spacing between the letters which must be at least 0.12 times the font size.

13
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:08,666
 
In this case I used letter-spacing, which would be the space between the letters

14
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:19,466
 
and letter-spacing, in fact, allows developers to control the amount of white space between characters.

15
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:41,632
 
As we can see this is the result obtained on the web page, and if I increase this value, the space between the various letters will also increase.

16
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,700
 
So the space will become double.

17
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,066
okay, 

18
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:54,066
 
finally there is the spacing between words,

19
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:58,299
 
which must be at least 0.16 times the font size.

20
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:02,832
 
In this case I decided to use word-spacing,

21
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:11,299
 
and as we can see between one word and the other there are spaces

22
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:18,233
 
and precisely by increasing this value, the space between one word and another will also increase.

23
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:26,733
 
I also decided to deepen two other criteria: the c36 criterion and the c35.

24
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:31,399
 
The c36 allows replacement of text spacing

25
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:39,766
 
and there are various ways to allow text spacing to be replaced and both affect the height.

26
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:51,466
 
In fact, as we can see in this case I have declared two paragraphs, one in bold and another with a simple font

27
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,433
 
a neutral font,

28
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:59,299
 
and I declared as height, an automatic height

29
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:08,866
 
and as we can see we have no difficulty in reading the text and the two paragraphs are in fact legible.

30
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:16,199
 
Same thing happens when we delete the height and therefore don't define it

31
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,833
 
same thing happens with this one ..

32
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:31,966
 
Also using the file that I found on the reference site that checked all the various spacings,

33
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:40,066
 
in fact, as we can see, even using this file will not change anything and the text will still be readable.

34
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:55,100
 
Instead, when we are going to specify a precise height, we put a height of 10 pixels in the first paragraph and in the second paragraph we put a height of 20 pixels

35
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:12,733
 
as we can see in this case the two paragraphs will overlap and even using the spacing file, verification found on the site, we will see that in any case the text will not be readable.
